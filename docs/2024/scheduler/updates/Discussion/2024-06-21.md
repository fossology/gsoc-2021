## Discussion:

**Contributor:**

 - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Presented a thorough analysis of a use case, identifying several important aspects:
    1. Clear separation of dependent and independent job queues.
    2. Implementation of a rate limiter using a sliding window log.
    3. Application of semaphores for queue synchronization.
    4. Integration of feedback through *[Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/)*.

 > ⚠️ In the diagram above, mutexes and channels for synchronization haven't been considered yet. Introducing single semaphore into the diagram might undermine the goal of achieving parallelism in extreme situations.

    
- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Concluded that the architecture faces several challenges:
    1. Potential deadlocks from using multiple semaphores.
    2. Limitations of using a single semaphore under certain conditions affecting multiprogramming.
    3. The need for a load balancer to prioritize users based on their analysis needs or project size.
    4. Establishment of a heartbeat mechanism to monitor system performance.

**Mentors**:

  - [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208): Discussed the potential deadlock issues with the use of multiple semaphores.

  - [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Suggested the implementation of a heartbeat system, possibly through Grafana, to oversee system health.

  - [Katharina Ettinger](https://github.com/EttingerK): Asked about the scalability of the current approach given the project size and complexity.

  - [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd): Proposed integrating a priority mechanism within the dependent queue to optimize processing time for smaller or less complex projects.

 >ℹ️: Additional studies and enhancements are considered for these areas.
