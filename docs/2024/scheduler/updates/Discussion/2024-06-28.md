# Meeting 16
*(June 28,2024)*

## Attendees:

  - [Katharina Ettinger](https://github.com/EttingerK)

  - [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

  - [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal)

  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78)


## Discussion:

- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): 

  Shared the updated architecture of the Scheduler via this link for team review:
  <!-- change it! -->
  [Scheduler Architecture](../../asset/golang_arch.png)
  
  Detailed enhancements to overcome specific challenges:
  1. Deadlock handling through channels facilitating communication between two semaphores, intended to transmit data structures, ideally integers representing user IDs or group IDs.
  2. Addressing race conditions among go-routines.
  3. Implementing a heartbeat mechanism between go-routines and a load balancer, utilizing channels to check the state of go-routines, returning a boolean value to minimize overhead in frequent signaling.

- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd): Emphasized the importance of package size as a critical parameter in Fossology, suggesting communication to users about partitioning large packages or providing a UI page for package size-related settings.

- [Katharina Ettinger](https://github.com/EttingerK): Questioned the criteria for determining whether packages are of larger or smaller size before processing begins.

- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd): Clarified that the `Unpackage` agent determines the package size, stating that the current setup looks promising and encouraged starting coding for further enhancements.

- [Katharina Ettinger](https://github.com/EttingerK): Inquired about the possibility of pausing smaller packages as a form of context switching.

- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Noted that context switching is currently handled under go-routines, which are synchronized per user, making pausing not feasible at the moment.

- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd): Suggested the development of a web page to make informed decisions based on package size.

- [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal): Complimented the improvements from the previous version and recommended proceeding with coding.
