# Meeting 10
*(June 14, 2024)*

## Participants:
  - [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78)

## Discussion Topics:

**Contributor:**
  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Could you provide more details on the ER diagram? I need to know the specific parameters to integrate into the code.

**Mentor:**
  - [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Let's discuss the data within the database and the essential criteria to consider when operating the scheduler:

    1. Certain agents like delagent and software heritage must operate singularly due to their time-intensive nature, affecting users who need to run multiple agents.

    2. Some agents depend on external APIs with rate limits. Surpassing these limits could lead to access restrictions or complete blocks on agent processing.

    3. A maintenance agent exists to support our website, focusing on dependency resolutions and performance enhancements.

    4. Ensure responsiveness is a priorityâ€”analysis for users who request first should be completed first.
