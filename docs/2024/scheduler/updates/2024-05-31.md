## Discussion

### Contributor

- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Focused on framing the current scheduler by studying the Job Scheduler `wiki` [Documentation](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Job-Scheduler).

#### Current Scheduler Design

The schematic from the documentation provides an architectural overview of the current Job Scheduler:

**Architectural Overview:**

The design is based on a client-server model, featuring:

1. **Scheduler Port**: Serves as the communication hub between clients and the scheduler.
2. **Main Thread**: Responsible for job queuing, allocation, and event management.
3. **Worker Threads**: Implement specific tasks asynchronously, enhancing throughput and response times.

**Key Components:**

1. **Scheduler**: Manages all job scheduling operations and acts as the primary interface for job requests.
2. **Asynchronous Workers**: Improve processing time by handling tasks in parallel.
3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides integrated systems for real-time monitoring and issue troubleshooting.

### Alignment with Documentation

**Mentor:**
- [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Confirmed alignment with the current architecture of the job scheduler.

#### New Scheduler Design

The revised design focuses on a more efficient multithreaded approach:

**Architectural Overview:**

1. **Main Thread**: Coordinates with various components and manages task execution.
2. **Worker Thread**: Manages interactions between different services to prevent conflicts.
3. **Event Queue**: Ensures proper handling of system-level events and error logging.

**Key Components:**

1. **Scheduler**: Uses a round-robin technique to manage tasks, ensuring efficient CPU time distribution.
2. **Queue Storage**: Manages tasks dynamically to adapt to workload changes.

#### Trade-offs

| Feature               | Old Job Scheduler    | New Job Scheduler    |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Maintainability       | Easier               | More challenging     |
| Monitoring            | Centralized          | Decentralized        |
| Resource Management   | Static               | Dynamic              |

### Effectiveness of New Design

**Mentor:**
- [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Suggests a finite state machine architecture might be more suitable given the complexity, as it facilitates easier tracking and management.

### Addressing FOSSology Issue

**[#2742](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/2742)**: Problem with incorrect MIME type recognition for text files.

**Mentor:**
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd): Error found due to the "Ignore SCM files" option affecting MIME type recognition.

### Wfx Project Approach

**Mentor:**
 - [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208): Expressed interest in holding an internal discussion about the [wfx](https://github.com/siemens/wfx) project approach.

### Goals for the Week

**Contributor:**
- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Goals include rewriting the existing C code to Go and implementing a queue in Golang.
