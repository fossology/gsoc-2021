- [**Akash Sah**](https://github.com/Akashsah2003): Completed the report generation for SPDX, handling tag values and License expressions. Currently enhancing the main license codebase, delving into the codebase, and clarifying aspects in the application report.

- [**Rajul Jha**](https://github.com/rajuljha): Concluded work on custom keywords functionality, which aids in directing scanner operations to specified locations and keys as requested by the user.
    Continued development on the differential scan design, utilizing the `GitHub API` and `GitLab API` to implement distinct tagging strategies discussed in the previous meeting, which assist in distinguishing scan types.

- [**Gaurav Mishra**](https://github.com/GMishx): Discussed the architecture of differential scanning, which requires two inputs per your suggestions. Several methods were considered, inspired by Git's differential scanning mechanisms in pull requests and merging capabilities. Identified four modes of execution:
    1. Based on Pull Request
    2. Scanning of a repo
    3. User-defined Tags
    4. Current release vs. Pre-release

- [**Aaditya Singh**](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Based on discussions from the previous week, proposed solutions to encountered problems, including:
    1. Deadlock Handling 
    2. Heartbeat Mechanism
    3. Load based on User
    4. Synchronization between Semaphores.
    Explained how the Golang Scheduler functions.

- [**Gaurav Mishra**](https://github.com/GMishx): Advised on organizing PRs based on commits to track weekly progress rather than batching all commits into one PR.

- [**Divij Sharma**](https://github.com/dvjsharma):
