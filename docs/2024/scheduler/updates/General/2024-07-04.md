## Discussions:

**Mentors:**

  - [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Provided general project updates.

  - [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal): Advised [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78) to continue using the existing `cmake` build system, explaining that `bazel`, while efficient, does not meet the current needs of Fossology. Changing the build system now is not advisable.

  - [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Suggested [Akash Sah](https://github.com/Akashsah2003) to open an issue on the SPDX tool.

**Contributors:**

- [Divij Sharma](https://github.com/dvjsharma)
  - Developed endpoints supporting standard copyright agents for URLs, emails, and authors.
  - Updated details in a previously mentioned PR and completed unit tests for Job endpoints.

- [Abhishek Kumar](https://github.com/abhi-kumar17871)
  - Conducted validations of JSON RDF & LDA formats and completed work on GitHub workflows & tag value report generation.

- [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
  - Completed differential scans and revised PR accordingly. Plans to test the allow-list functionality next week and explore GitHub actions and Docker Compose.

- [Abdelrahman Jamal](https://github.com/Hero2323)
  - Achieved approximately 70% accuracy in semantic searches, effectively identifying correct licenses. Aims to increase accuracy to 90% next week and will require integration with LLM and some prompt engineering.

- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78)
  - Began coding the scheduler through database connectivity. Facing decisions about the build system `cmake`, which does not support Go. Created documentation on the general coding structure in Go, following the hexagonal architectural pattern.

- [Akash Sah](https://github.com/Akashsah2003)
  - Addressed bugs in the tag value report. Focused on improving the RDF report and integrating it into the database's license table to eliminate duplicates.

- [Shreya Gautam](https://github.com/ShreyaGautamm)
  - Written a Python script to fetch copyright content from the database and modified the copyright. Will tackle a GitHub action issue next.

- [Valens Niyonsenga](https://github.com/valens200)
  - Finalized the addition of controllers and models concerning permission licenses on agents. Plans to work on test cases.
