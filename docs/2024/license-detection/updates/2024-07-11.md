# Meeting 7

*(July 4,2024)*

## Attendees:
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
- [Ayush Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)
- [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal)
- [Anupam Ghosh](https://github.com/ag4ums)

## Discussion:

### Improved Semantic Search Algorithm

- Presentation of Improved Algorithm

  1. Approach: Implemented chunking by dividing code comments and paragraphs into multiline strings, starting new chunks at empty lines.

  2. Challenges: Original method of extracting comments resulted in long, merged lines, necessitating a rework to handle multiline comments effectively.

- Chunking Example

```
/*
This is a multiline comment
that should be considered as one
single chunk for better accuracy.

This is a separate chunk.
*/

// This is a single line comment

// This is still a single line comment
// This is also still a single line comment and not a chunk with the previous comment 
```
### License Matching Performance

- Initial Results

  1. Accuracy: The chunking approach significantly improved license matching accuracy but struggled with extremely similar licenses (e.g., 0BSD and ISC).

  2. Problem: Minor differences between very similar licenses led to occasional misidentifications.

- License Text Examples

```

- Enhancements

1. Chunk Merging: Attempted merging potential chunks to improve license identification by providing more comprehensive text for comparison.

2. Combined Line and Chunk Matching: Implemented both line and chunk matching to enhance accuracy, though it increased processing time due to the greater number of combinations.

- Results

  1. Metrics:
    Predicted License Accuracy: 93.33%
    Predicted Licenses Covered: 84.0%

  2. Notes: Approximately 5% of the remaining 7.6% were files referring to a different license file, not containing the license text directly.

- Matching Output Example:

### Key Findings

- Enhanced Accuracy: The combination of chunking and line matching improved overall accuracy and coverage.

- Increased Processing Time: The dual approach led to longer search times due to the increased number of combinations.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

- Evaluate on Nomos Test Dataset:

  1. Dataset Links:
       - [LastGoodNomosTestfilesScan](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/nomos/agent_tests/testdata/LastGoodNomosTestfilesScan)
       - [NomosTestfiles](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/tree/master/src/nomos/agent_tests/testdata/NomosTestfiles)

  2. Objective: Assess the performance of the semantic search and LLM integration on the provided test datasets.

- Limit Line/Chunk Matching: To address the issue of excessive matches, limit the line/chunk matching to optimize search time and accuracy.

- Additional Tasks

  1. Acknowledgement from Notice Files: Begin work on identifying and acknowledging licenses from notice files.

  2. Obligations: Convert identified licenses to obligations, detailing the requirements and conditions of each license.
