# Week 6
*(July 05, 2024 - July 11, 2024)*

## Meeting 1
*(July 10, 2024)*

## Attendees
* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
* [Shaheem Azmal](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
* [Kaushlendra](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
* [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal)

## Discussions
* Mentioned about the progress and completion of [#PR2785](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2785) which adds the relevant byte info the nomos scanner's JSON Output.
* Also got review from mentors regarding [#PR2784](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2784) which allows for the user to pass a custom `allowlist.json` file for whitelisting certain licenses or keywords.
* Gave a demo to the mentors on how the Github Action for Fossology Scanners works. I studied `docker` actions as well as `composite` actions and decided to go for the composite actions because:
  * **Emulation on our end**: Composite actions give us the flexibility to run multiple steps in our jobs which makes it easier for us to implement QEMU Emulator for cross platform image support de-facto.
  * **Uploading Artifacts**: Using composite actions, the user does not need to set up a separate step of uploading the results as an artifact, as we can add this step into our action itself. User can just provide the `report_format` key to tell the script which report to generate. Thus, it ensures less clout for the user.


## Work Done
* Completed the allowlist functionality and sent a [#PR2784](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2784) for the same.
  * The user can now pass a `allowlist.json` file in a particular [format](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/utils/automation/allowlist.sample.json) like this:
    ```yaml
    {
    "licenses": [
            "GPL-2.0-or-later",
            "GPL-2.0-only",
            "LGPL-2.1-or-later"
        ],
        "exclude": [
            "*/agent_tests/*",
            "src/vendor/*"
        ]
    }
    ```
  * The script looks for the file allowlist file first. If not found here, then looks for `allowlist.json` file in the root directory. If not found here then looks for `whitelist.json`. If this is also not found, populates an empty dictionary with `license` and `exclude` keys.
  The decision tree looks like this:

* As discussed and resolved in the previous meeting, the `start`, `end`, and `len` information is updated into the nomos JSON output in this [#PR2785](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2785).

* Started working on the line number part for `nomos` and `ojo` scanners.

* Researched and understood the different Github Actions and decided to go with [`composite` actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) as they allow us to customize our action in an easier manner.
* Implemented a demo Github Action for testing and demo'd it to the mentors.

## Planning for next week
* Need to complete the action, test all cases and boundary conditions.
* Once the action is completed, we need to think about a name for it and publish it to the Github Marketplace.
* After that, resume working on the line number part for the `nomos` and `ojo` scanners as well.
